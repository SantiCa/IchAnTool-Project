# Changelog

All notable changes to SedCoreTool are listed here, newest first.

**Versioning.** Each delivery has a number `V0.<n>`, shown in the program and used as the version `0.<n>.0` of the
program, the Python package and the desktop installers. Version 1.0 will be released when the program is considered
complete. Before 5 November 2026, development builds were numbered V1–V33; V33 became V0.1.

Technical details of every method are in [docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md).

---

## V0.96 — 2026-11-09
- Flag invalid analysis regions and broken mask references when opening a project, with an inspection mode that preserves the original data.

## V0.95 — 2026-11-09
- Warn in the section editor when an opened project has invalid depths or units.

## V0.94 — 2026-11-09
- Add a reproducible browser and Python performance baseline for the public IODP example and a larger synthetic core.

## V0.93 — 2026-11-09
- Clarify contributor rules for scoped performance work, incremental rollouts, dependency review and numerical regression tests.

## V0.92 — 2026-11-09
- Check JavaScript type regressions in CI, with strict JSDoc contracts for analysis, image processing and shared state.

## V0.91 — 2026-11-09
- Escape formula-like text in CSV and Excel exports while preserving numeric measurements.
- Reject oversized or malformed ZIP project and U-Net training imports before unsafe expansion.
- Read only documented manifest columns using fixed text and depth types.

## V0.90 — 2026-11-09
- U-Net training switches to CPU if GPU memory is insufficient and resumes from the last completed checkpoint. Use `--cpu-only` to force CPU execution in the Python CLI.

## V0.89 — 2026-11-09
- Classify large multidimensional arrays of BI and ii faster in Python with the same interval results.

## V0.88 — 2026-11-09
- Reclaim unused overlap stacks during long editing sessions while preserving undo and trace order.

## V0.87 — 2026-11-09
- Open supported large TIFF and BigTIFF images by strip or tile, and retain 16-bit samples for levels and gamma.
- Save original images in bounded writes so project saving does not require loading each entire file into memory.

## V0.86 — 2026-11-08
- Verify both architectures of the universal macOS package when their application archives are separate.

## V0.85 — 2026-11-08
- Desktop builds load the sample core for Electron testing and verify that installers contain only the coastline from the examples directory.

## V0.84 — 2026-11-08
- Drag the name column edge in Multiproxy interval families to resize it within the side panel.

## V0.83 — 2026-11-08
- Collapse the numeric variable list in Multiproxy and read interval class names in fields that use the available panel width.
- Reorder and hide tracks, including automatic classifications, directly from the Multiproxy curves toolbar.
- Choose which proxies to show in each multiproxy log figure independently of the analysis.
- Select entire projects for a cross-project analysis and customise site map colours and symbols by project or core.

## V0.82 — 2026-11-07
- Preserve imported series when combining age-only and depth-based tables using a suitable age model; report imports that cannot be converted safely.

## V0.81 — 2026-11-07
- Ignore invalid geographic coordinates in multiproxy maps and interpolation.
- Prevent exporting an earlier figure when drawing the current figure fails.

## V0.80 — 2026-11-07
- Multiproxy resampling preserves measured values beside large gaps and applies the automatic gap limit when the field is blank.

## V0.79 — 2026-11-07
- Preserve age-only series when importing additional variables into an existing core.

## V0.78 — 2026-11-07
- New optional column «Sections» (Core column and the «Core column» figure): an empty column with one box per section
  showing its name or number, vertical or horizontal (Scales and style → row «Sections»). It can be shown, hidden and
  reordered like any other column; off by default.

## V0.77 — 2026-11-07
- "Open idealised example" on the home screen no longer appears (and fails silently) when the program has no sample
  data; `npm start` in `desktop/` now copies the sample data so the example buttons work when developing. Errors
  loading the example are logged in the console.

## V0.76 — 2026-11-07
- Language: the parts that stayed in Spanish in English now follow the language: formula errors (Data tab and computed
  columns), the test core (name, age-model note, magnetic susceptibility record), the map background credits and the
  moving-average fit label (now `movavg(n)`).

## V0.75 — 2026-11-07
- Core column: the title and the shape of the bioturbation column and the title of the ichnotaxa column move into their
  rows of the table of columns (width, limits, divisions), and the separate "Divisions of % axes" field is gone: the
  Div. cell of each percentage column now shows the default (4) and replaces it when filled in.

## V0.74 — 2026-11-07
- Depth scale: a "Ruler scale" button fills in the intervals from one value (short tick every n, medium every 5n, number
  and long tick every 10n, lengths 3, 5 and 8 px). It is available in the Core column panel and in the figure panel.

## V0.73 — 2026-11-07
- Figures: several versions of a figure can be kept in the project as tabs above the figure. `+` makes a new tab as a copy
  of the current figure; double-click renames it; `×` deletes it. Each tab keeps its own type, title, orientation,
  columns and series, and edits are saved in the active tab. Projects saved before open with a single tab.

## V0.72 — 2026-11-07
- Figures: vertical or horizontal orientation is now set separately for each figure type, instead of applying to all of
  them. Projects saved before keep their single orientation for the types you do not change.

## V0.71 — 2026-11-07
- No visible change: the save indicator keeps its internal state "saved" (used by the end-to-end test); the warning
  colour for "no folder backup" is a separate attribute.

## V0.70 — 2026-11-07
- Figures: the hatched or solid fill of intervals without data was blank in the preview of "Core column (current window)"
  (and of the multiproxy log) when that view had been opened before, because both copies of the drawing shared the same
  internal names. Each figure now has its own names.

## V0.69 — 2026-11-07
- Depth scale of the core column and of the figures: besides the numbered ticks, the long and the short ticks there is now
  a medium tick, each level with its own interval and its own length, so a ruler-style scale is possible (for example
  short every 1, medium every 5, long and number every 10). The same form is used in the column panel and in the figures.
- The section figure now respects the length of the numbered ticks.

## V0.68 — 2026-11-07
- Section figure: intervals without data now show the chosen fill (hatched or solid) over the image, not just the "No data"
  text on a blank background.

## V0.67 — 2026-11-07
- The save indicator no longer says just "Saved" when no backup folder is chosen: it reads "Saved on this computer · no folder
  backup" (or "folder backup pending" when the folder needs permission again) in the warning colour, and "Saved" only
  once the automatic folder backup is active.

## V0.66 — 2026-11-07
- No visible change: the multiproxy tool (records, layers, classifiers, maps) moves out of `app.js` into its own file.

## V0.65 — 2026-11-07
- No visible change: the composite log, the side panels and the Data tab move out of `app.js` into their own files.

## V0.64 — 2026-11-07
- No visible change: the interface code is split into smaller files (shared state and the figures panel now have
  their own modules), a first step towards dividing `app.js`.

## V0.63 — 2026-11-07
- Security: the build tool electron-builder pulled `minimatch` 9.0.9 and 10.2.6 (Dependabot alert #64, pattern
  amplification when parsing glob patterns). `desktop/package.json` now forces `minimatch` 11.0.1 for those two
  branches (`overrides`); `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities and the Linux installers still build. The alert only
  affected the build tooling, not the installed program.

## V0.62 — 2026-11-07
- Column headers stay visible while scrolling in the data tables, the spreadsheet view, the results and comparison tables.

## V0.61 — 2026-11-07
- Release notes brought up to date; `tools/sync_version.py` now also writes the version into
  `desktop/RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `--check` fails if it differs, so a release can no longer carry old file names.

## V0.60 — 2026-11-07
- Python package: exclusion layer (`exclude=` in `analyze_mask`, `--exclude` image or `--exclude-value` on the command
  line); intervals with too few valid pixels have no data (`min_valid`, 20 % as in the program). Percentages are now
  computed as the ratio of sums, as in the program (identical results without exclusions).
- New `sedcoretool batch` and `sedcoretool manifest`: analyse many section images and several cores from one CSV
  manifest; sections are joined by depth with gaps kept and a choice for overlaps (keep, upper, error).
- LAS 2.0 export (`-o file.las`, `export.to_las`), one file per core.
- `--bin-cm` on the command line; output tables gain `depth_top`, `depth_bottom` and `valid_pct`; BI and ii are empty
  (not −1) where there is no data.

## V0.59 — 2026-11-07
- Text, subtitle and background colours can also be changed in the multiproxy map and the location map; the
  sections figure, the trace gallery and figure titles and captions follow the core-column colours.
- Colours stored in a project are checked before drawing; invalid values fall back to the defaults.
- `sedcoretool unet prepare --overwrite` replaces a previous dataset; other non-empty folders are still refused.

## V0.58 — 2026-11-07
- Reserving cores for the final test now excludes only the library and other-project examples that may come from
  them (same core identifier or name, or identical trace descriptors), and shows how many were excluded.
- Age models: repeated identical rows are merged; a depth with two different ages is reported by depth; an
  incomplete age range is ignored with a warning instead of rejecting the whole model.

## V0.57 — 2026-11-07
- When the desktop program cannot save on closing, a dialog offers to retry, export the project or close without
  saving, instead of silently refusing to close.
- Repository links point to the renamed repository `SantiCa/SedCoreTool`.

## V0.56 — 2026-11-07
- Customise figure colours for core columns, ichnotaxon distributions and multiproxy columns, or restore defaults.
- Show or hide hand-placed identification marks in core columns and whole-core figures without deleting them.
- Legends of the core column and whole-core figure list only the ichnotaxa present in the displayed interval.

## V0.55 — 2026-11-07
- Keep the desktop window open when saving fails, including when a save is already in progress.
- Reject duplicate age depths and invalid named age ranges; blank age cells are ignored instead of read as zero.
- Prevent U-Net preparation from mixing existing tiles and reject overlapping validation and test core lists.
- Exclude external ichnotaxon examples while cores are reserved and retain source keys in exported models.
- Fit multiproxy scaling and missing-value imputation on training samples only, and exclude reserved cores from k-means fitting.

## V0.54 — 2026-11-07
- Documentation reorganised for public readers: everything in English, no duplicated content, one guide for
  contributors and AI coding assistants (`AGENTS.md`, also read by Claude through `CLAUDE.md`), and this changelog as
  the single version history. The software paper moved to `paper/`; internal planning notes left the repository.

## V0.53 — 2026-11-07
- Technical documentation rewritten in English for any reader (`docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`): organised by the
  program and the Python package, describing current behaviour, with the full Python API and command line.
- README explains which part — the program or the Python package — each user needs.

## V0.52 — 2026-11-07
- Renamed **SedCoreTool** (formerly CorAnTool and IchAnTool). The Python package and command are now `sedcoretool`;
  `ichantool` keeps working as a deprecated alias.
- Shareable project packages use the extension `.sedcoretool`; `.corantool` packages and projects saved under older
  names still open. Saved data are kept: browser storage, the IndexedDB database and the desktop data folder are
  reused.
- `.zenodo.json` describes the software and links it to the archive of version 2.1 (Zenodo 3518837).

## V0.51 — 2026-11-07
- Ichnotaxa distribution figure: choose the ichnotaxa shown and the column width; abundance as symmetric (kite)
  curves, with or without symbols.
- Horizontal orientation for every figure except maps.
- Excluded zones can be hidden in every figure that shows core images.

## V0.50 — 2026-11-07
- Installers and the offline file carry no sample data, only the public-domain Natural Earth coastline; example
  buttons appear only when the program runs from a copy of the repository.

## V0.49 — 2026-11-07
- Final test on reserved cores: reserved cores never train nor take part in model selection (ichnotaxa and
  multiproxy); a logged final test reports accuracy, balanced accuracy and the confusion matrix.
- Automatic comparison with version 2.1: exact with the same mask (unit test) and within 0.6 percentage points with
  the browser's JPEG decoder (end-to-end test); the small difference was traced to the decoder, not the method.

## V0.48 — 2026-11-07
- Desktop builds run an Electron start/close/restart test before packaging, with optional checks of the vision model
  and map backgrounds.
- Manual builds can prepare an unpublished release draft with the five installers, the offline file, a manifest and
  SHA-256 checksums.

## V0.47 — 2026-11-06
- Electron 45.2.1 and electron-builder 26.18.0. macOS 13 or later is now required.

## V0.46 — 2026-11-06
- Continuous-integration workflow maintenance; component versions synchronised.

## V0.45 — 2026-11-06
- SheetJS updated to the official 0.20.3 build with its licence (fixes CVE-2023-30533 and CVE-2024-22363), with an
  SRI-checked online fallback.
- The DINOv2 vision model is pinned to a verified Hugging Face commit and SHA-256.

## V0.44 — 2026-11-06
- Projects are saved section by section: only changed sections are rewritten (IndexedDB version 5).
- Faster trace deletion; enhancement computed in the background when a section is opened.
- Exported tables and record import moved to a tested module (`exportio.js`).

## V0.43 — 2026-11-06
- New figure: core location map with base layers (blank, vector, Esri imagery), zoom and pan, WGS 84 / Web Mercator /
  UTM, graticule or metric grid, coordinates on any side in DD, DMS or metres, scale bar and north arrow (with UTM
  convergence), and SVG/PNG/JPEG output.

## V0.42 — 2026-11-06
- Editing algorithms (scissors, merge, undo, project migration) moved to a tested pure module (`edit.js`).
- End-to-end test in headless Chrome (open, detect, delete and undo, save, reload, compare) in continuous
  integration.

## V0.41 — 2026-11-06
- Performance: enhancement and detection run in a background worker; images are reduced directly to their output size;
  a separate memory budget for undo; kriging solves one linear system per map (O(n) per cell).

## V0.40 — 2026-11-06
- Single version number across the program, the Python package and the installers, checked by a test.
- Continuous integration on Windows, macOS and Linux with coverage, linters (ruff, ESLint) and the offline build;
  release script; Content-Security-Policy and SRI; security policy, code of conduct, issue and pull-request
  templates, and third-party notices.

## V0.39 — 2026-11-06
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA): accessible names for all sliders, keyboard-operable tabs, live status regions,
  optional single-key shortcuts, AA colour contrast in both themes, larger touch targets.

## V0.38 — 2026-11-06
- Table import handles quoted fields, thousands separators and Windows-1252 files, and reports cells read as empty.
- Consent before map backgrounds send the study area to Esri or GEBCO.
- The SHA-256 of the vision model is stored in the project.
- The automatic folder copy covers every modified project, retries on failure and warns when it is out of date.

## V0.37 — 2026-11-06
- Age model: decimal commas, columns chosen by header, warning for pasted Bacon tables.
- Ichnotaxa evaluation always leaves whole sections (or cores) out and reports the validation scheme.
- Multiproxy classifiers exclude the parent and child layers of the target, rescale per fold and leave a gap between
  validation blocks.
- Automatic choice of enhancement without identified traces uses a contrast-invariant, spatially coherent criterion.
- Corrected variogram weighting reference.

## V0.36 — 2026-11-06
- Safer data: project format 5; files from newer versions open read-only; masks validated on import and opening; a
  failed load saves nothing; pending changes saved when the page is hidden or closed.
- Provenance header (version, settings) in every exported CSV.
- Replacing a project on import keeps the local copy; rotated daily backup history; storage quota warning;
  uncaught errors shown to the user.

## V0.35 — 2026-11-06
- The Data tab is a spreadsheet: values can be edited (flagged, with original value and date, restorable and listed in
  the CSV); computed columns with interpolation between records measured at different depths; manual columns.

## V0.34 — 2026-11-06
- Multiproxy: colour records by one or several interval layers.
- Intervals of a layer never overlap within a core; touching intervals of the same class are joined.

## V0.33 — 2026-11-06
- All charts: reorder and hide columns without deleting data.

## V0.32 — 2026-11-06
- Ichnotaxa distribution figure: one symbol per identified trace or hand-placed mark, with its own depth or age axis.

## V0.31 — 2026-11-05
- Charts: choose which ichnotaxa are drawn, stacked or each in its own column with its own scale.

## V0.30 — 2026-11-05
- Traces overlap only when their ichnotaxa differ; the brush extends a trace of the active ichnotaxon.

## V0.29 — 2026-11-05
- Overlapping traces enabled by default (remembered, key S).

## V0.28 — 2026-11-05
- Age model with an age range; import of Bacon (rbacon) `*_ages.txt` tables; `age_min`/`age_max` in the CSV and an
  age-uncertainty track.
- Automatic choice of enhancement measures how well identified traces separate from the matrix, and also tries each
  colour channel.

## V0.27 — 2026-11-05
- Interface review: one-row top bar, bundled IBM Plex fonts, collapsible sections, two-line column titles,
  colour-blind-safe record palette, navigation strip next to the depth ruler.

## V0.26 — 2026-11-05
- Layout: only panels scroll; panel widths adapt to the screen; status bar always visible.
- Navigation strip to move through a section; Show all, Page Up/Down, Home/End.

## V0.25 — 2026-11-05
- Every figure with a core image: width, several versions side by side, and excluded zones shown or hidden.

## V0.24 — 2026-11-05
- Bioturbation side column: each track has its own width and can be hidden.

## V0.23 — 2026-11-05
- Core column: image panels side by side (original, enhanced, traces, arrows…) with true photo proportions.
- Configurable NO DATA style; trace symbol size and border; arrow options.

## V0.22 — 2026-11-05
- Vertical axes with numbered, long and short ticks, each with its own interval and length; editable scales in
  Multiproxy.

## V0.21 — 2026-11-05
- Bioturbation side column: adjustable width, fixed horizontal scales and records from the Data tab.

## V0.20 — 2026-11-05
- Overlapping traces: total bioturbation counts an overlap once, while each ichnotaxon keeps its full area. The Python
  package accepts one mask layer per class.
- Scissors tool to split a trace; Merge for several selected traces.

## V0.19 — 2026-11-05
- Hover help on almost every control (Spanish and English), which can be turned off.

## V0.18 — 2026-11-05
- Desktop program: own application icon.

## V0.17 — 2026-11-05
- Desktop program: train a U-Net on the computer's GPU (one-time training module, validation and test cores,
  progress, stop and resume).
- Ichnotaxa: optional features from a pre-trained vision model (DINOv2) instead of the 12 shape descriptors.

## V0.16 — 2026-11-05
- Documentation of the U-Net training protocol.

## V0.15 — 2026-11-05
- Learned segmentation (U-Net): training-data export from the program; a detection method that runs a trained ONNX
  model (probability threshold, uncertain zones); Python `unet` commands (prepare with split by core, train, evaluate
  on whole images of independent cores, predict) with identical tiling rules in Python and JavaScript.

## V0.14 — 2026-11-05
- TIFF and spreadsheet libraries bundled, so the program works offline; new README.

## V0.13 — 2026-11-05
- Drawing errors are reported with their own message.

## V0.12 — 2026-11-05
- Symbols by default in the ichnotaxa distribution figure (bars optional); one symbol shape per ichnotaxon, shared
  with marks and legends.

## V0.11 — 2026-11-05
- Shared vertical units and ticks across the core column and figures; logarithmic and explicit horizontal axes.
- Editable label text and positions, saved with the project and included in exports.

## V0.10 — 2026-11-05
- List of selected traces; browse all traces of the current image.

## V0.9 — 2026-11-05
- Interface fix in the ichnotaxa list.

## V0.8 — 2026-11-05
- Shareable project package (ZIP) with full-resolution images; automatic copy as project folders (for example in a
  shared Drive folder) and Open project folder; replace-or-copy when the same project is opened again.
- Comments with author, date and replies, linked to a point of a section.

## V0.7 — 2026-11-05
- Representative-traces figure: several versions of each trace side by side and a configurable scale.

## V0.6 — 2026-11-05
- Width and axis format of each column next to the core.

## V0.5 — 2026-11-05
- Style options for the column and its figure; marker styles and label handling in the sections figure.

## V0.4 — 2026-11-05
- Intervals with too few valid pixels (default < 20 %) have no data instead of 0, shown as NO DATA.

## V0.3 — 2026-11-05
- Identification marks can be shown together with quantified tracks.

## V0.2 — 2026-11-05
- Images are added to a core chosen in a dialog; ichnotaxa can be hidden while interpreting.
- Depth window and track selection for all figures; faster row counts and predictions.

## V0.1 — 2026-11-05
- Original images stored once on disk; pixels loaded only for the sections in use.
- Per-section working resolution can be changed later; cropping without re-encoding.
- Analysis interval set in centimetres, with the same rule in the program and the Python package (`bin_cm`).
