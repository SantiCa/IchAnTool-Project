# Contributor and AI-assistant guide

This file is the single set of working rules for anyone changing SedCoreTool: human contributors and AI coding
assistants alike (Codex, ChatGPT, Claude and others). Claude reads it through `CLAUDE.md`, which only imports this
file. Keep the rules here and nowhere else.

Owner and maintainer: Santiago Casanova-Arenillas. **Reply to the owner in Spanish**; everything committed to the
repository (code, comments, documentation, commit messages) is written in English.

## 1. What the project is

SedCoreTool quantifies bioturbation and ichnotaxa in sediment-core images and combines them with other down-core
records. It has two parts that share the same analysis definitions:

| Part | Path | Language |
|------|------|----------|
| The program (desktop and browser) | `app/` (web application), `desktop/` (Electron packaging) | JavaScript, no build step |
| The Python package `sedcoretool` | `src/sedcoretool/` (`src/ichantool/` is a compatibility alias) | Python ≥ 3.10 |
| Reference version 2.1 (2019) | `legacy/` | Python 3.7 — never modify |

Start with [README.md](README.md) for users and [docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md)
for how every part works (§1.4 maps the source files).

## 2. Repository map

```
app/            program: index.html, js/ (ES modules), vendor/ (bundled libraries and fonts)
desktop/        Electron main process, preload, U-Net trainer, build scripts, release notes
src/sedcoretool Python package (analysis, command line, U-Net)
tests/          Python tests, program tests (tests/app), end-to-end tests (tests/e2e), fixtures
examples/       public example data used by tests and by the program when run from the repository
tools/          offline build, version sync, release, vendor update, synthetic data generators
docs/           technical documentation and roadmap
paper/          software paper (JOSS) and its bibliography
legacy/         original version 2.1, unchanged
```

## 3. Setting up and running

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"                 # Python package with test dependencies
pytest -q                               # Python tests
npm test                                # program tests (Node 22; same as: node --test tests/app/*.test.mjs)
npm ci && npm run typecheck             # JavaScript type checks (Node 22)
python3 -m http.server 8765             # then open http://localhost:8765/app/
python3 tools/build_standalone.py       # offline file -> dist/SedCoreTool_V0.<n>.html (dist/ is not committed)
cd desktop && npm ci && npm start       # desktop program; npm run dist builds installers for the current system
npm i --no-save puppeteer-core@23 && node tests/e2e/smoke.mjs   # browser end-to-end test (needs the server above and Chrome)
```

On Windows with a local virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`, `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e
".[dev]"`, then `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q`. Do not reinstall dependencies if the environment works.

## 4. Rules for code

- **Shared definitions.** Interval limits, percentages, indices and depth mapping must stay identical in Python
  (`src/sedcoretool/`) and JavaScript (`app/js/core.js`); U-Net tiling likewise (`unet/tiling.py`, `app/js/unet.js`).
  Keep the regression test against `legacy/v2.1_console/example_output.csv` passing.
- **Pure modules.** `core.js`, `edit.js`, `imageproc.js`, `learn.js`, `log.js`, `zip.js`, `geo.js`, `interp.js`,
  `locmap.js`, `plot.js`, `sheet.js`, `exportio.js` and `unet.js` must not use the DOM, so they can be tested with
  Node. A new module must be added to `ORDER` in `tools/build_standalone.py`, and top-level names must not clash
  across modules.
- **Compatibility of saved data.** Do not rename the browser storage keys (`ichantool.*`, `corantool.*`), the
  IndexedDB database `ichantool`, the desktop origin `app://corantool` or `window.corantoolDesktop`: users would lose
  their projects. Keep reading project files written as `IchAnTool` or `CorAnTool` and `.corantool` packages. Keep the
  `ichantool` Python alias.
- **Public APIs.** Preserve existing callers. Any approved breaking change needs a documented migration path
  and regression coverage for supported inputs.
- **Measure performance.** Back performance claims with a reproducible benchmark. Record the inputs,
  environment and measured quantities, and use the baseline in [M0.1](docs/roadmap.md#m01-acceptance-criteria)
  when it covers the affected path.
- **Safe I/O.** Handle corrupt, oversized and hostile inputs. Bound resource use when processing untrusted
  files. For filesystem project saves, use a temporary file and atomic replacement where supported. For
  IndexedDB, use transactions. Verify recovery and preservation of the last good save after a failed write.
- **Incremental delivery.** Split broad changes into small, independently testable deliveries. Gate major refactors
  behind a feature flag and keep the current path as the default until the new path passes its acceptance criteria.
  Define how to roll back and when to remove the flag.
- **Dependency discipline.** Prefer existing or standard-library facilities. Justify new dependencies with a
  concrete capability or measured benefit. Before adding a heavy dependency, compare it with the smallest viable
  alternative and document the maintenance, runtime and distribution costs, including offline and desktop use.
- **No private data.** Never commit unpublished data or results of the owner or anyone else. The repository and the
  downloads contain only public example data.
- **Interface texts** go in `app/js/i18n.js`, in Spanish and English.
- **Regression coverage.** Add tests for new features and behaviour changes. Use property-based tests for
  critical invariants where appropriate. When changing scientific code, test numerical equivalence against
  reference results on representative inputs and relevant edge cases. Use exact equality where required and
  define and justify any tolerances before validation. Test an explicitly requested scientific change against
  its new expected results and verify that unaffected outputs remain equivalent. Documentation-only edits
  require no new tests.
- **Documentation.** Update user and technical documentation as required by [section 5](#5-delivering-a-change).

## 5. Delivering a change

Every delivery that changes code, algorithms, defaults or files includes, in the same commit:

1. **Next version number** `V0.<n>` (the latest is the top entry of `CHANGELOG.md`). Set `DELIVERY` in
   `app/js/app.js` and run `python3 tools/sync_version.py`, which writes `0.<n>.0` to `pyproject.toml`,
   `src/sedcoretool/__init__.py`, `CITATION.cff` and `desktop/package.json` (a test checks them).
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`:** a new entry at the top, `## V0.<n> — YYYY-MM-DD`, with short user-facing bullets (what changed
   for the user, not how the work was organised).
3. **`docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`** if an algorithm, formula, default value, file format or validation result
   changes. Formulas there must match the code exactly. It describes current behaviour for any reader: no history, no
   notes addressed to reviewers.
4. **README** if what users see or do changes.
5. **Tests pass:** `pytest -q`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `python3 tools/sync_version.py --check`, `ruff check src tests tools`;
   run the end-to-end test when the interface or saving changes. Do not re-run them on an unchanged, already verified
   state.
6. **Commit** on `master` with the message `V0.<n>: <summary>` and a short body. Select files explicitly.

Version 1.0 is reserved for when the owner declares the program complete.

**Releases.** `tools/release.sh` checks branch, clean tree, versions and tests, and pushes the tag `V0.<n>`; GitHub
Actions (`.github/workflows/desktop.yml`) then builds Windows, macOS and Linux installers and publishes the Release.
A manual run of *Desktop builds* on `master` with `draft_release` prepares an unpublished draft instead. Before a
release, update `desktop/RELEASE_NOTES.md` (the text of the GitHub Release). Only the owner decides when to publish a
release or a DOI.

## 6. Documentation: what goes where

| Content | Place |
|---------|-------|
| What the software is for, installation, how to use it | `README.md` |
| How each part works: methods, formulas, defaults, file formats, validation | `docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` |
| What changed in each version | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| Planned work | `docs/roadmap.md` |
| Desktop release notes (text of the GitHub Release) | `desktop/RELEASE_NOTES.md` |
| How to contribute (humans) | `CONTRIBUTING.md` (short; points here) |
| Working rules (humans and AI assistants) | this file |
| Software paper | `paper/` |

Do not repeat content between these files; link instead. Keep the tone factual and professional.

## 7. Working with several people or assistants

- **One editor at a time** on a shared working copy, even for different files: the version number and the changelog
  are shared. Other sessions may read and review.
- **Before editing:** `git fetch origin`, `git status --short --branch`, and `git pull --ff-only` on a clean tree.
  A dirty tree may contain someone else's work: do not stash, reset, clean or discard it, and do not switch branches.
- **Before committing:** fetch again; if someone else delivered meanwhile, rebase or merge and take the next free
  version number. Never force-push or overwrite others' work.
- **Start each iteration** by reading this file and the current [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md). Find the task
  the maintainer authorised, its acceptance criteria and its editor and reviewer, when assigned. The roadmap
  orders the work. Starting a task requires the maintainer's authorisation.
- **Handoff.** Update the roadmap status when handing work over or delivering it. For an unfinished task,
  record the next step or blocker and point to the work under review if available. Mark a task complete once
  its criteria and required checks pass, and link its changelog entry in the same delivery. Sessions rely on
  the repository for handoffs.
- **GitHub handoff.** At each reviewable checkpoint, check whether the next editor or reviewer can retrieve the
  commit from GitHub. If a push is needed, tell the maintainer promptly and provide the branch, commit SHA,
  checks run and next step. If the work is still local and uncommitted, say what needs to be committed first.
  Raise this at the checkpoint so the handoff can happen even if the session ends early. Push only when authorised.
- **Explain each step to the maintainer.** After completing each step, report in Spanish what you did, how you
  checked it and how any implementation works within SedCoreTool as a whole. Describe the affected components and
  how data or control passes between them. Include open work and limitations in the final report.
- **Interpret requests by intent.** If the maintainer gives a broad instruction, infer the smallest concrete scope
  from the request, the repository and the roadmap. Identify the affected workflow and acceptance criteria before
  editing. For performance work, choose the specific path, representative inputs and a reproducible benchmark for
  before-and-after comparison. State material assumptions and ask only when the goal or a consequential choice
  cannot be inferred.
- **One phase at a time.** Split requests that combine independent workstreams, such as UI, GPU, WASM and DuckDB,
  into ordered, independently verifiable phases. Work on the first authorised phase and record the others in the
  roadmap. Do not start unrelated refactors, audits or backlog work. Do not launch sub-agents or automations unless
  asked.
- **Reporting to the owner:** briefly, in Spanish — result, how it was checked, version number, and anything that is
  genuinely pending.
