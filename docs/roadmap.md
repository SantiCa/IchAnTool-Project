# Roadmap

The current state, the next task cards and the decisions waiting for the maintainer. Working rules are in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); the structure that the cards build is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md); commands
are in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md). Later milestones and ideas: [roadmap-future.md](roadmap-future.md).
Finished tasks: [roadmap-history.md](roadmap-history.md).

**How to use it.** Read *Status and handoff*. Do the first step listed there. A task is described by a card
([format and roles: AGENTS.md §6](../AGENTS.md#6-working-on-a-task)); carry out one card at a time, in order, and
only when the maintainer has authorised it. When you stop, update the status block so that a new session can
continue from this file alone. When a card is done, link its changelog entry, move its long record to the history
file and leave one line here.

## Status and handoff

Updated 12 November 2026.

- **Released version:** [V0.148](../CHANGELOG.md#v0148--2026-11-12) on local `master` (`2aca696`). `master` is
  ahead of `origin/master`; nothing is pushed without the maintainer's request.
- **Active work branch:** `work/2026-11-12`. Its changes are under `## Unreleased` in the changelog. No version
  number is assigned; the maintainer asks for it.
- **Checks:** see the last line of this block; it is rewritten at the end of every session.
- **Where we are:** M8.1 and M8.2 are done at the development gate (Windows). The engine process, its bundled
  runtime and its packaging work and are measured; the engine still computes nothing scientific. The repository
  documents were restructured for task-card work (this file, AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md).
- **Next step:** card **M8.3.1** (move the section analysis out of `app.js`). It is *Ready*; starting it needs
  the maintainer's go-ahead.
- **Decisions waiting for the maintainer:**
  1. Confirm or change the two acceptance levels (below) and the proposed scope of version 1.0.
  2. Push the branch to GitHub: it would back up the work (everything since V0.128 exists only on this computer)
     and let the *Desktop builds* workflow build and smoke-test macOS and Linux, which the release checklist needs.
  3. Create version V0.149 from the branch.
  4. The flags in the table below that need a promote/remove decision.
- **Last full checks:** pending on the final commit of the 12 November 2026 session; previous full pass at
  `e829470`.

## How work is accepted

Adopted on 12 November 2026 when the maintainer asked for this restructuring; it replaces the earlier rule that
every platform and performance gate had to pass before the next task could start.

| Level | Needed for | What must be true |
|---|---|---|
| **Development gate** | Starting the next card | The card's "Done when" holds; its tests and the session checks pass on the maintainer's Windows workstation; anything unfinished is behind a flag that is off by default; evidence states what was not measured. |
| **Release gate** | Switching a flag on by default, or publishing a version to users | Everything in the [release checklist](#release-checklist): all supported platforms, clean machines, and the numerical, timing, memory and recovery gates of [contract §7](roadmap-engine-contract.md#7-predeclared-verification-and-performance-gates). |

Never report the release gate as met from development evidence. A failed gate is recorded with its measurement;
it is not hidden, and limits are not relaxed to pass it.

### Flags

Every experimental switch, with the decision it is waiting for ([policy: ARCHITECTURE §5.3](ARCHITECTURE.md#53-add-promote-or-remove-an-experimental-flag)).

| Flag | Owner | How it is switched | Default | Waiting for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engine experiment | M8 | environment variable `SEDCORETOOL_ENGINE_EXPERIMENT=1` | off | Removed at M8.6 after the release gate |
| NumPy multi-row counting in the Python API | M3.1.5 / M3.1.6 | environment variable `SEDCORETOOL_EXPERIMENTAL_COUNTS=1` | off | Decided inside card M8.3.3 (which counting kernel becomes the only one) |
| Navigation preview rollback | M2.2.4 | session control in the Sections panel | preview on | Maintainer: remove the rollback control, or keep it until more memory evidence exists |
| Visible-row table rendering | M2.1.3 | session-only checkbox in the Data table | off | Maintainer: promote to default or remove |
| Desktop operating diagnostics | M1.2.3 | opt-in control in the desktop program | off | Removed after the hang diagnosis of M1.2.2 is accepted |

## Scope of version 1.0 (proposal, not yet confirmed by the maintainer)

Proposed so that "needed for 1.0" has a meaning; the maintainer edits or replaces this list.

- **In:** M8 complete (one scientific engine, desktop packages for Windows, macOS and Linux passing the release
  gate); M5.1 compatibility and reproducibility; M5.2 scientific validation and documentation, including a
  comparison with expert estimates on real cores; software paper and archived release (DOI).
- **Not required:** multi-gigabyte images (M2.3 beyond what M8.4 needs), advanced statistics (M6), radiographs
  (M7), optional acceleration (M4), a new interface shell (M9).

## Active priority: desktop and one scientific engine

Direction approved by the maintainer on 12 November 2026; the design, its rules and the recorded decisions are in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). In one sentence: every scientific method is implemented once in Python and
runs in a local engine process; the Electron/JavaScript interface requests and shows results; the Python API and
command line call the same code directly.

| Order | Milestone | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | M8.1 Inventory and engine contract | done ([V0.141](../CHANGELOG.md#v0141--2026-11-12)) |
| 2 | M8.2 Engine process, bundled runtime, packaging | done at the development gate; release items in the checklist |
| 3 | **M8.3 First scientific slice: section intervals** | **next: cards below** |
| 4 | M8.4 Engine-owned images and large files (includes M2.3) | cards written when M8.3 passes its development gate |
| 5 | M8.5 Remaining methods, one slice at a time | idem |
| 6 | M8.6 Release gate, default-on, duplicate JavaScript science removed, HTML version frozen | idem |
| 7 | Statistics (M6), radiographs (M7), validation and publication | [roadmap-future.md](roadmap-future.md) |
| 8 | Conditional: acceleration (M4), interface shell (M9) | [roadmap-future.md](roadmap-future.md) |

### Cross-cutting objective: modularity and reviewability

Requested by the maintainer on 12 November 2026: the program must be modular, easy to understand and easy to
edit, so that a change needs little reading and few review rounds. It is applied through the layer rules of
[ARCHITECTURE §3](ARCHITECTURE.md#3-layers-and-dependency-rules), the recipe for moving a workflow out of
`app.js` (§5.2) and the "Read first / Change / Do not touch" fields of every card. It does not start a
whole-program refactor: each M8 slice moves the workflow it touches.

## M8 - Desktop simplification and a single scientific engine

- [x] **M8.1 - Engine inventory and migration contract.** [V0.141](../CHANGELOG.md#v0141--2026-11-12) ·
      [contract](roadmap-engine-contract.md) · [record](roadmap-history.md#m8---completed-engine-migration-tasks)
- [x] **M8.2 - Local engine process and reproducible packaging** (development gate, Windows).
  - [x] M8.2.1 Process and transport — [V0.142](../CHANGELOG.md#v0142--2026-11-12)
  - [x] M8.2.2 Bundled runtime — [V0.143](../CHANGELOG.md#v0143--2026-11-12)
  - [x] M8.2.3 Windows packaging and lifecycle — unreleased, [record](roadmap-history.md#m823---packaging-and-lifecycle-acceptance-windows)
  - [x] M8.2.4 Follow-up of 12 November 2026 — unreleased, [record](roadmap-history.md#m824---follow-up-of-the-windows-acceptance)
  - Numbers to remember (Windows 11, Ryzen 7 7700X): window visible 0.45 s; engine ready 0.7–0.8 s with the
    verification record, 1.5–2.0 s with a full verification, 3.7–3.9 s on the first launch after extracting the
    ZIP; forced stop 5 ms; idle process tree 5 processes, about 310–410 MiB summed working set.

### Release checklist

What the development gate does **not** cover. All of it must hold before M8.6 switches the engine on by default
or a version with the engine is published. Tick an item only with recorded evidence.

- [ ] macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon, universal disk image) and Linux (AppImage, DEB): runtime preparation, native
      smoke check, packaged start-up and close. Needs those machines or a run of the *Desktop builds* workflow
      (requires pushing; maintainer's decision).
- [ ] Clean Windows machine (no Python, no Node) and at least one other antivirus configuration.
- [ ] First launch with a cold disk cache (after a reboot) against the 5 s engine-ready gate. Measured so far:
      3.7–3.9 s right after extraction; 11–25 s before the runtime was pruned. Measure once after the next reboot
      with `tools/measure_packaged_startup.mjs <exe> --runs 1`.
- [ ] Whole-process memory, timing, responsiveness, cancellation and recovery gates of contract §7 on the first
      scientific slice (measured in card M8.3.8).
- [ ] Engine start-up with all CPUs saturated: runtime verification took 16 s median before pruning and the
      verification record; repeat `tools/measure_engine_lifecycle.mjs --load 16`.
- [ ] Installer and portable sizes recorded for every platform.

### M8.3 - First scientific slice: section intervals

**Outcome.** With the experiment on, the interval percentages, per-class percentages, BI and ii of a section are
computed by the engine method `section.intervals/1` and shown by the existing interface; with it off, nothing
changes. Inputs and results are defined in [contract §4–§5](roadmap-engine-contract.md#4-scientific-input-contract-sectionintervals1);
the path of a request is [ARCHITECTURE §4](ARCHITECTURE.md#4-path-of-one-scientific-request-target-design-for-m83).
Cards are done in order. Each one claims the development gate only.

#### M8.3.1 - Move the section analysis out of `app.js` — state: Ready

- **Goal:** the calculation that fills `s.bins` lives in a pure module that Node can test. No behaviour changes.
- **Read first:** [ARCHITECTURE §3.2 and §5.2](ARCHITECTURE.md#32-renderer-appjs); `app/js/app.js` functions
  `effClassId`, `effClassArray`, `analyze`, `binRowsOf`, `manualAt` (search by name; about 45 lines in total);
  `app/js/core.js` functions `rowCounts`, `binRows`, `interpAge`, `interpAgeRange`; `app/js/sectiondepth.js` and
  `tests/app/sectiondepth.test.mjs` as the model of an earlier extraction.
- **Change:** create `app/js/sectionanalysis.js` and `tests/app/sectionanalysis.test.mjs`; edit `app/js/app.js`
  (the five functions become one-line wrappers that pass `S` in), `tools/build_standalone.py` (`ORDER`, after
  `sectiondepth.js`), the source map in `docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` §1.4, `CHANGELOG.md` (Internal).
- **Do not touch:** any formula, default, rounding or order of operations; `core.js`; the callers of `analyze`;
  the shape of `S`, of `s.bins` or of saved projects.
- **Steps:**
  1. In the new module write `effectiveClassId(object, settings)`, `effectiveClassIndex(section, classes, settings)`
     and `computeSectionBins(section, project)` where `project = { classes, settings, ageModel }`. Move the bodies
     as they are; replace every read of `S` by a parameter. `computeSectionBins` returns `{ bins, rowCache }`; it
     reuses `section._rc` when its key matches, exactly as today.
  2. Turn the `app.js` functions into wrappers; `analyze(s)` assigns `s.bins` and `s._rc` from the result.
  3. Add the module to `ORDER` and to the source map.
  4. Tests in Node on a small hand-built section: assigned, predicted (above and below the threshold) and candidate
     objects; a class that does not count; an overlap stack with the same and with different classes; excluded
     pixels; a ROI that does not start at 0; `minValid` exactly at the limit; no-data padding; two overlapping
     manual ranges (the last one wins); ages inside and outside the model. Compute the expected values by hand in
     the test, with a comment for each.
- **Tests:** `node --test tests/app/sectionanalysis.test.mjs`; `npm test`; `npm run typecheck`;
  `python tools/build_standalone.py`; browser smoke test `node tests/e2e/smoke.mjs` (results of the public example
  unchanged).
- **Done when:** `app.js` no longer contains the calculation; all commands above pass.

#### M8.3.2 - Reference fixtures for `section.intervals/1` — state: Ready after M8.3.1

- **Goal:** small committed fixtures, each holding the inputs of contract §4 and the results of contract §5,
  produced by the JavaScript calculation. They are the target every later card must reproduce.
- **Read first:** contract §4, §5 and the "Required inputs" row of §7; `app/js/sectionanalysis.js`;
  `tests/fixtures/fractional-boundaries.json`.
- **Change:** add `buildIntervalSnapshot(section, project)` and `referenceColumns(section, project)` to
  `app/js/sectionanalysis.js`; create `tools/make_interval_fixtures.mjs`, `tests/fixtures/section-intervals/*.json`,
  `tests/app/interval-fixtures.test.mjs`.
- **Do not touch:** the calculation moved in M8.3.1; the contract's names, dtypes and units (if one cannot be
  produced, stop and report: the contract is amended by a design session, not silently).
- **Steps:**
  1. `buildIntervalSnapshot` returns the eight inputs with the contract's exact names: `labels`, `exclude`,
     `objects`, `classes`, `stack_offsets`, `stack_members`, `settings`, `age_model`, `manual_indices`. It copies
     data; it does not compute effective classes.
  2. `referenceColumns` returns every output column of §5, including `valid_pct`, the raw counts and each
     `<name>_valid` column, from `rowCounts` and the bins.
  3. The tool builds synthetic sections (seeded, no files read) for: the cases listed in M8.3.1 step 4; units mm,
     cm and m; a section with no valid pixels; the 20 fractional-boundary cases; a section of about 600 × 2,000
     pixels with a few hundred objects. One JSON file per case: `{ name, inputs, expected }`, arrays as lists with
     `dtype` and `shape`. Keep the folder under 2 MB.
  4. The Node test regenerates every fixture in memory and requires byte-identical content to the committed file.
- **Tests:** `node --test tests/app/interval-fixtures.test.mjs`; `npm test`; `npm run typecheck`.
- **Done when:** fixtures are committed and the regeneration test passes.

#### M8.3.3 - Python kernels — state: Ready after M8.3.2

- **Goal:** the primitives of interval analysis exist once, in `src/sedcoretool/kernels/`, and the public Python
  functions use them.
- **Read first:** [ARCHITECTURE §3.1](ARCHITECTURE.md#31-python-srcsedcoretool); `src/sedcoretool/pipeline.py`,
  `indices.py`, `depth.py`; `app/js/core.js` (`rowCounts`, `binRows`, `classify`, `interpAge`, `interpAgeRange`);
  contract §4, the paragraphs after the input table.
- **Change:** create `kernels/__init__.py`, `kernels/binning.py` (pixels per centimetre, interval size in rows,
  half-up edges, sums per interval), `kernels/counting.py` (valid, bioturbated and per-class counts per row from
  a label image, an object→class table, CSR overlap stacks, an exclusion mask and a ROI; and from class layers),
  `kernels/classification.py` (tier classification with `precedence="first" | "last"`), `kernels/ages.py`
  (central age and range at a depth, missing outside the model); `tests/test_kernels.py`,
  `tests/test_architecture.py`; edit `pipeline.py`, `indices.py`, `depth.py` to delegate.
- **Do not touch:** public signatures, DataFrame columns, error messages and results of the Python API and CLI;
  `engine/`; JavaScript.
- **Steps:**
  1. Write the kernels. Counting works in bounded blocks of rows and must not allocate a classes × height × width
     array. An overlap pixel counts once in the total if any counted object covers it and once for each distinct
     counted class.
  2. Make the public functions call them. Both counting paths of `pipeline.py` (default and
     `SEDCORETOOL_EXPERIMENTAL_COUNTS=1`) must give identical results through the kernel; then keep one
     implementation, record the measured choice under M3.1.6 in [roadmap-future.md](roadmap-future.md), and tell
     the maintainer the flag can be removed.
  3. `tests/test_architecture.py` parses imports with `ast` and enforces the table of ARCHITECTURE §3.1.
- **Tests:** `pytest -q tests/test_kernels.py tests/test_architecture.py`; then the whole `pytest -q` with no
  existing test modified.
- **Done when:** all Python tests pass unchanged, including the regression against `legacy/`.

#### M8.3.4 - Method `section.intervals/1`, called directly — state: Ready after M8.3.3

- **Goal:** `src/sedcoretool/methods/section_intervals.py` reproduces every fixture of M8.3.2.
- **Read first:** contract §4 and §5 (complete); ARCHITECTURE §3.1 and §5.1; the fixtures.
- **Change:** create `methods/__init__.py`, `methods/errors.py` (`MethodError(code, field)` with the contract's
  codes), `methods/registry.py`, `methods/section_intervals.py`, `tests/test_section_intervals.py`.
- **Do not touch:** kernels' behaviour (add parameters only if a fixture needs them, with a kernel test);
  `analyze_mask` and the rest of the public API.
- **Steps:**
  1. `parse(inputs)` validates everything in §4 before computing: shapes and dtypes, ROI inside the image,
     `exclude` only 0/1, unique positive object IDs, class references that exist, stack offsets monotonic with no
     dangling or duplicate members, finite numbers, units, positive interval, thresholds in [0, 1]. Each failure
     raises `MethodError` naming the field. Nothing is repaired or dropped silently.
  2. `run(snapshot, report, cancelled)` follows the order of §4: effective class of each object → counts → interval
     sums → percentages with the minimum-valid rule → no-data padding → indices → ages → manual indices. It calls
     `cancelled()` between row blocks and returns the columns of §5 with their `_valid` columns.
  3. The test runs every fixture: exact equality for row bounds, counts, indices, `no_data` and every `_valid`
     column; absolute error ≤ 1e-9 for depths, percentages and ages. Add one failing-input test per validation rule.
- **Tests:** `pytest -q tests/test_section_intervals.py tests/test_architecture.py`.
- **Done when:** every fixture passes without changing a fixture or a tolerance.

#### M8.3.5 - The engine process runs registered methods — state: Ready after M8.3.4

- **Goal:** a client can send a snapshot to the real coordinator, run `section.intervals/1` in the worker and
  download the result columns.
- **Read first:** contract §3; `src/sedcoretool/engine/server.py`, `worker.py`, `buffers.py`;
  `tests/test_engine_transport.py`; technical manual §26.2.
- **Change:** `engine/server.py` (operation `section.analyze`; a generic job runner instead of the digest-only
  one; `hello` lists both methods), `engine/worker.py` (loads the method from the registry, reads input buffer
  files with NumPy, writes output buffer files and a small result description), `engine/buffers.py` (adopt worker
  outputs as committed buffers within the session budget; read a range of a committed buffer);
  `docs/roadmap-engine-contract.md` (add the operation `buffer.read {handle, offset, byte_length}` → response
  followed by one binary frame of at most 1 MiB; describe the job description passed to the worker);
  `docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` §26.2; `tests/test_engine_transport.py`.
- **Do not touch:** the frame format, limits and error codes; the coordinator stays standard-library only (the
  architecture test enforces it); `buffer.digest/1` keeps working.
- **Steps:** implement; then prepare the runtime again (DEVELOPMENT §4) because Python sources changed.
- **Tests:** a fixture through the real coordinator and worker returns identical columns; cancellation while
  queued and while running returns `cancelled` and leaves no file or budget charge; an invalid snapshot returns an
  error response and the session stays usable; killing the worker returns `INTERNAL`.
  `pytest -q tests/test_engine_transport.py tests/test_architecture.py`.
- **Done when:** those tests pass and `npm run prepare-runtime -- --offline` succeeds.

#### M8.3.6 - Main-process client and renderer bridge — state: Ready after M8.3.5

- **Goal:** the page can upload buffers, start and cancel a section analysis and read results through a narrow,
  validated bridge.
- **Read first:** [ARCHITECTURE §3.3](ARCHITECTURE.md#33-electron-main-process-desktop); `desktop/engine.js`,
  `desktop/engine-protocol.js`, `desktop/preload.js`; how `desktop/main.js` checks the sender for `trainer:*` calls;
  `tests/app/engine.test.mjs`.
- **Change:** `desktop/engine.js` and `engine-protocol.js` (accept the two methods in `hello`; operations
  `section.analyze` and `buffer.read`, including a binary frame in a response); create `desktop/engine-ipc.js`;
  `desktop/main.js` (register it); `desktop/preload.js`; `desktop/scripts/build.js` (`files` list);
  `tests/app/engine.test.mjs`, new `tests/app/engine-ipc.test.mjs`.
- **Do not touch:** `engine:status`; trainer and diagnostics bridges; the rule that the page never supplies paths,
  executables or operation names.
- **Steps:** the bridge offers exactly: `status()`, `beginBuffer(descriptor)`, `appendBuffer(token, offset, bytes)`
  (at most 1 MiB), `commitBuffer(token)`, `analyzeSection(request)`, `cancel(requestKey)`,
  `readBuffer(token, offset, length)`, `release(tokens)`. `engine-ipc.js` checks the sender origin as the trainer
  handlers do, validates every argument's type and size, maps page tokens to engine handles and releases all
  handles of a page when it reloads or closes.
- **Tests:** Node tests with a fake `EngineClient` for validation and token ownership; one Node test with the
  bundled runtime that runs a fixture end to end through `engine-ipc.js` functions.
- **Done when:** tests pass; `node desktop/scripts/check-package.js` still passes after `npm run dist`.

#### M8.3.7 - The interface shows engine results under the flag — state: Ready after M8.3.6

- **Goal:** with the experiment on, `s.bins` comes from the engine; with it off, from the JavaScript calculation.
- **Read first:** [ARCHITECTURE §4](ARCHITECTURE.md#4-path-of-one-scientific-request-target-design-for-m83);
  contract §2; `app/js/sectionanalysis.js`; the seven call sites of `analyze` (`app.js`, `columns.js`).
- **Change:** `app/js/sectionanalysis.js` (`analysisRevision(section, project)`, `resultToBins(result)`); create
  `app/js/engineclient.js` and its Node test with a fake bridge; `app/js/app.js` and `columns.js` (callers await
  `analyzeSections(sections)`); `app/js/i18n.js` (pending and error texts, `engine.error.<CODE>`);
  `tools/build_standalone.py` (`ORDER`); `tests/e2e/desktop.mjs`.
- **Do not touch:** the JavaScript calculation (it stays as the default and as the reference); the shape of
  `s.bins`; saving and project files.
- **Steps:** a result is published only if session, section and revision are still current; an older, cancelled
  or failed job changes nothing; while a section waits, its results show a pending state and never an older
  revision as current; a failure shows a translated error and does not fall back to JavaScript.
- **Tests:** Node tests for revision changes, stale-result rejection and `resultToBins` on the fixtures; desktop
  end-to-end with the flag on: the six sections of the public example match the JavaScript reference (exact
  counts and indices, 1e-9 on floats), then edit → undo → redo, CSV export and save → reopen; with the flag off
  the existing end-to-end passes unchanged.
- **Done when:** both end-to-end runs pass and the full session checks pass.

#### M8.3.8 - Acceptance measurements and decision — state: Ready after M8.3.7

- **Goal:** the gates of contract §7 are measured on the first slice and the maintainer decides what follows.
- **Change:** a measuring tool under `tools/`, evidence under `docs/validation/`, the release checklist above.
- **Steps:** numerical parity on the public six-section example and the generated eight-section M0.1 project at
  2 and 1.37 cm; matched timing (flag off/on, alternating order); interface responsiveness and cancellation during
  the largest case; whole-process memory; ten open/analyse/close cycles; kill the worker and the coordinator
  mid-job and interrupt a save.
- **Done when:** every gate has a recorded pass or a recorded failure with its measurement, and the maintainer
  has chosen: continue to M8.4, or correct first.

### M8.4 to M8.6 - summaries

Cards are written by a design session when the previous milestone passes its development gate.

- [ ] **M8.4 - Bounded engine data and image services.** Engine-owned native images, chunked operations and a
      bounded tile/cache interface; the renderer receives visible tiles, editing updates and result summaries
      instead of holding a second copy of every image. Implements M2.3.1–M2.3.5
      ([roadmap-future.md](roadmap-future.md)).
  - Acceptance: the multi-gigabyte contract covers the complete Electron/engine process tree, disk usage, buffer
    ownership and memory release after closing a project; native pixels, editing coordinates, masks/history and
    atomic save/backup recovery are preserved; raising heap or image limits alone does not pass.
- [ ] **M8.5 - Migrate the remaining scientific methods,** one slice at a time with the recipe of
      [ARCHITECTURE §5.1](ARCHITECTURE.md#51-add-or-migrate-a-scientific-method): (a) depth/age parsing and
      record/formula transformations; (b) image filters, detection and object features; (c) ichnotaxon
      classifiers and embeddings; (d) multiproxy rules, models, interpolation and fitted statistics; (e) U-Net
      inference, then training integration after M3.2.5.
  - Acceptance per slice: independent reference fixtures, explicit provenance, unchanged public contracts; exact
    counts/masks/labels and predeclared tolerances elsewhere; figures and exports unchanged.
- [ ] **M8.6 - Promote desktop and retire duplicate computation.** After the release checklist passes: the engine
      becomes authoritative, migrated JavaScript calculations are removed from the desktop program, their role as
      reference passes to versioned fixtures, and the last supported HTML version is frozen with a tested
      export/import path for its stored projects.
  - Acceptance: one implementation per method; identical API, CLI and desktop results; complete desktop and
    interrupted-save regressions; storage identifiers and old project readers retained; documents and CI updated
    in the same delivery; engine errors stay visible.

## Small maintenance cards

Independent of M8; each can be done in under an hour when the maintainer asks.

- [ ] **H1 - The desktop end-to-end test prepares its own files.** `tests/e2e/desktop.mjs` depends on
      `desktop/web` containing the sample data, which `npm run dist` removes (it failed for that reason on
      12 November 2026). Make the test run `desktop/scripts/prepare.js --with-examples` itself, or fail at once
      with a clear message when the sample is missing. Done when the test passes right after `npm run dist`.
- [ ] **H2 - Check the failed requests for optional sample files in packaged builds.** The packaged program logs
      `net::ERR_UNEXPECTED` for `app://corantool/app/data/idealized_core_0-500cm.jpg`,
      `app/data/land-50m.json` and `examples/data/idealized_core_0-500cm.jpg` at start-up. Find out whether these
      are the intended probes for absent optional files (then answer them with a clean 404) or a wrong path for
      the coastline file. Done when the cause is written here and, if it is a defect, fixed with a test.
- [ ] **H3 - Move raw benchmark reports out of the repository.** `docs/benchmarks/*.json` weighs about 10 MB.
      Needs the maintainer's decision on where the raw files go; the `.md` summaries stay.

## Later milestones

Not scheduled. Details, acceptance criteria and the backlog are in [roadmap-future.md](roadmap-future.md).

| Area | Tasks |
