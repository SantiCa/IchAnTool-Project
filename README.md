**SedCoreTool** (*Sediment Core Tool*) quantifies bioturbation and ichnotaxa in sediment-core images and combines them
with any other down-core record — geochemistry, foraminifera, TOC, colour, magnetic susceptibility — and with
described intervals, on a common depth or age axis.

It runs on Windows, macOS and Linux, or in a web browser, and keeps all data on the user's computer. A Python package
with the same analysis definitions is available for scripting and batch processing.

> **Status:** version 0.x, in active development. Version 1.0 will be released when the program is considered
> complete. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Features

- **Bioturbation from core images.** Percentage of bioturbated area and of each ichnotaxon per depth interval, with
  the Bioturbation Index (BI) and the ichnofabric index (ii) derived automatically or entered manually.
- **High-resolution TIFF.** Import tiled or stripped TIFF and BigTIFF in supported grayscale or RGB formats.
  Enhancement uses native 16-bit samples for levels and gamma, and the project keeps the original image.
  See [working resolution and TIFF limits](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md#61-working-resolution).
- **Assisted segmentation.** Image enhancement (including published protocols), automatic detection of candidate
  traces, drawing and editing tools, an exclusion layer for cracks, voids and samples, and optional learned
  segmentation (U-Net).
- **Ichnotaxa identification.** A classifier learns from the traces you label and suggests the ichnotaxon of the
  rest, rejecting shapes unlike any example; you review every suggestion.
- **Core column.** All sections of a core on one depth or age axis, with images, traces, indices and external records.
- **Multiproxy analysis.** Numerical records and described intervals of many cores; user-defined classifiers
  (random forest, neural network, k-nearest neighbours, naive Bayes, k-means) validated by leaving whole cores out;
  maps by age window with several interpolation methods and projections.
- **Publication figures.** Core column, ichnotaxa distribution, representative traces, core sections and core
  location maps, as SVG, PNG or JPEG, with editable colours, axes and labels.
  Whole-core, core-column and ichnotaxa distribution plots can combine separate, stacked or overlaid abundances,
  symmetric curves, adjustable opacity, percentage labels and symbols or names at manual presence marks.
- **Reproducible and shareable.** Every parameter is stored in the project together with the original images;
  exported tables record the version and settings used. Projects can be shared as a single file or through a shared
  folder, with comments.

## Installation

### The program

Download the installer for your system from the [latest release](../../releases/latest):

| System | File |
|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 (x64) | `SedCoreTool-V0.<n>-windows-setup.exe`, or `…-windows-portable.exe` (no installation) |
| macOS 13 or later (Intel and Apple Silicon) | `SedCoreTool-V0.<n>-mac-universal.dmg` |
| Linux (x64) | `SedCoreTool-V0.<n>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` or `…-linux-amd64.deb` |
| Any system, in a browser | `SedCoreTool_V0.<n>.html` — a single file that opens with a double click, offline |

The installers are not code-signed: on Windows choose *More info → Run anyway* if SmartScreen appears; on macOS open
the program the first time with right-click → *Open*. To update, install the new version over the old one; projects
are kept. Each release includes `SHA256SUMS.txt` and `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` to verify the downloads.

The program can also be run from a copy of this repository: start a local server (`python3 -m http.server`) and
open `http://localhost:8000/app/`.

### The Python package

```bash
pip install "sedcoretool @ git+https://github.com/SantiCa/SedCoreTool.git"
# optional extras: excel (Excel export), plot (matplotlib), unet (U-Net training)
pip install "sedcoretool[excel,plot] @ git+https://github.com/SantiCa/SedCoreTool.git"
```

Requires Python 3.10 or later. The package is not on PyPI yet.

## Which part do I need?

| | **The program** | **The Python package `sedcoretool`** |
|---|---|---|
| Starts from | Your core photographs | A **mask**: an image in which bioturbation is already marked (painted, colour-coded per ichnotaxon, exported from the program, or predicted by a U-Net) |
| Does | Everything listed under *Features* | Turns masks into depth or age series of bioturbation %, % per ichnotaxon, BI and ii; trains and evaluates U-Net models |
| For | Anyone analysing cores | Scripted and batch processing |

Most users only need the program. The desktop program uses the Python package behind the scenes when it trains a
U-Net on the computer.

## Quick start (program)

1. **Create a project** and add the images of a core, one per section, with the top and bottom depth of each.
   Large images are reduced for working; the original file is always kept. If an opened section shows a depth
   warning, correct its depth values or unit before using its interval results.
2. **Mark the bioturbation:** enhance the image, detect candidate traces or draw them, and exclude zones that must not
   be counted. Intervals with too few valid pixels are reported as *no data*, never as 0.
   Use **Undo** (Ctrl+Z or ⌘Z) and **Redo** (Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z or ⌘Shift+Z) in the image toolbar.
   Making a new edit after undoing clears Redo. Reopening a project starts with an empty editing history.
3. **Assign ichnotaxa** to some traces; the program suggests the rest, and you accept or correct the suggestions.
4. **Read the results** per interval (thickness in cm): bioturbation %, % per ichnotaxon, BI and ii. Add an age model
   to work in age.
5. **Combine and interpret** in the *Core column*, *Data* and *Multiproxy* modes, and prepare figures in *Figures*.
   In the Data sheet, **Visible rows only (experimental)** limits rendering while you scroll. It is off by default
   and applies only to the current session. Turn it off to return to the current table; CSV exports always include
   every selected row. Active text selections retain their rows until the selection is cleared.
   In Multiproxy, collapse *Numeric variables used* to free space, drag the edge of the name column in
   *Interval families* to resize it, and use *Column order and visibility* in *Curves* to reorder or hide tracks.
   Double-click the name column handle to restore the automatic width. Each multiproxy log
   figure can choose its own proxies. In *Across projects*, select entire projects for an analysis and set
   site map colours and symbols by project or core.
6. **Save and share:** projects are saved automatically on your computer. *Export this project (with images)* creates
   a `.sedcoretool` file that opens on any system; an automatic copy can be kept in a synchronised folder.
   If saving fails, the last complete save is preserved and your pending changes stay open. Use **Retry save**
   before opening another project, or export the current project to keep a separate copy. If the folder copy fails,
   use **Reactivate automatic backup** to retry it.
   A project with an invalid analysis region or broken mask references opens for inspection, with a warning in
   the affected section. Edits are temporary and a project export keeps the original data.

The built-in help and guided tour explain each step. The downloads contain no sample data.

In the **Sections** panel, **Optimised navigation preview** starts enabled and uses a separate thumbnail
cache for the section navigator. Disable it to use the previous renderer for the current session; reloading
enables it again. This display choice is not saved in projects. See the
[promotion checks and limits](docs/benchmarks/M2.2.4.md).

In **Figures**, use **Ichnotaxa in the charts** to choose abundance shapes and occurrences independently.
For names at manually identified positions, select **Names only** and **Manual marks only**; add bars or
symmetric curves and percentage labels as needed. Opacity 100% is opaque. Figure tabs keep their own choices.
The same controls are available in the core-column style panel; presence marks retain their depth or age and
do not supply a measured abundance. See the [figure presentation methods](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md#2031-ichnotaxon-presentation).

For a **Multiproxy log** figure, select the core, numeric variables and core tracks, then add ichnotaxa with
the same presentation controls. Use **Column order and visibility** to mix taxon, proxy, index and interval
tracks in the desired order. Height, window, widths, scales and colours belong to that figure tab. Reset the
composition to follow the Multiproxy view again; the analysis settings and other figures remain unchanged.
Use the figure's **Vertical axis** and image controls to select depth or age, panels, overlays and excluded
zones independently of Multiproxy and the core column. Age images require the selected core's age model.

**Whole interpreted core** and **Core column** figures also keep their own tracks, records, axes, colours,
widths and image options. Distribution and section figures keep their own style and depth window. Settings
are independent for each figure type and tab; **Restore inherited presentation** removes that type's
presentation override. Existing projects inherit their previous presentation until you edit these controls.
Malformed numeric map appearance settings fall back to their defaults when drawing or exporting figures;
the project's measurements are preserved.

## Quick start (Python package)

```bash
# image with bioturbation painted black; top and bottom of the image at 0 and 500 cm
sedcoretool analyze core.png --top 0 --bottom 500 --units cm --bin-px 100 -o core.csv

# colour-coded mask, e.g. the *_mask.png and *_palette.json exported by the program
sedcoretool analyze core_mask.png --top 0 --bottom 500 --palette palette.json --bin-cm 1 -o core.xlsx

# several sections and cores: list the images, fill in top/bottom, then run them all (CSV, Excel or LAS)
sedcoretool manifest scans/ -o scans/sections.csv
sedcoretool batch scans/sections.csv --palette palette.json --bin-cm 1 -o results.las
```

An exclusion image of the same size (white = excluded: cracks, gaps, samples) can be given with `--exclude`, or as
the `exclude` column of the manifest. The CLI accepts finite `--min-valid` fractions from 0 to 1, inclusive.
Multi-core LAS exports require distinct filenames and unused destinations. If core names collide after
normalisation, rename the cores or export them separately. Use a different output prefix if a destination exists.

```python
from sedcoretool import analyze_mask, load_image, mask_from_palette

mask, names = mask_from_palette(load_image("core_mask.png", "RGB"), {"Zoophycos": "#ff0000", "Chondrites": "#0000ff"})
section = analyze_mask(mask, top=0, bottom=500, units="cm", bin_cm=1, class_names=names)
section.add_age(model_depth=[0, 500], model_age=[0, 40_000])     # optional age model
section.data.to_csv("core.csv", index=False)                     # depth, bioturbation_pct, <class>_pct, BI, ii, age
```

CSV and Excel results escape text that spreadsheet programs could interpret as formulas. Project and U-Net ZIP
imports apply the [project ZIP limits](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md#231-project-packages-sedcoretool) and [U-Net ZIP limits](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md#92-training-data-and-training-python-package).
If a project package reports a CRC mismatch, use an intact copy of the package.

Centimetre intervals use the same row boundaries in Python and the application. When updating Python from
V0.120 or earlier, rerun analyses with fractional pixel intervals: corrected half-row boundaries can change
percentages and indices. See the [interval definition](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md#32-per-interval).

Use lossless formats (PNG, TIFF) for masks. The complete API, command line and U-Net commands are described in the
[technical documentation](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md#25-the-sedcoretool-python-package).
Python image and mask loading reports an error before decoding if a file exceeds its estimated 768 MiB
[per-load memory budget](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md#image-loading-budget).
Python analysis accepts integer label IDs from 0 to 255 and up to 255 classes. Use `--exclude-value` to
mark an ignore value in a CLI label mask.

**Learned segmentation (experimental).** A U-Net can be trained on the traces reviewed in the program — from the
desktop program (*Detection → U-Net → Train on this computer…*) or with `sedcoretool unet` — and then used as a
detection method. No model trained on real cores is distributed yet.

Desktop retraining keeps the last working model available until training and any required test-core evaluation
finish successfully. **Resume** continues the pending checkpoint; starting a fresh run replaces that pending
attempt. Use the model list to load the active version. See [desktop model storage and recovery](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md#93-training-on-the-computer-desktop-program).

Training checks GPU memory and continues on CPU if the accelerator is unavailable or runs out of memory.
Use `sedcoretool unet train DATA OUT --cpu-only` or `train(..., cpu_only=True)` to train on CPU without
probing CUDA or Metal. The `predict` and `evaluate` subcommands also accept `--cpu-only`.

When preparing training data from the command line, choose a new or empty output directory for each preparation.
Preparation assigns portable tile filenames and requires unique core/section identifier pairs. If a duplicate
is reported, correct the identifiers before retrying. Linked paths inside the output folder are refused.
Existing prepared datasets remain usable; keep the same prepared folder when resuming a training run.
While any core is reserved for a final test, the ichnotaxon classifier excludes all library and other-project
examples, whose independence cannot be established for older model files.

## Privacy

Images and data never leave the computer. The program connects to the internet only for optional downloads: map
backgrounds (Esri, GEBCO; only after you allow it, since the map extent is sent), the vision model (Hugging Face) and,
in the browser version, a few libraries. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## History and earlier names

SedCoreTool started in 2019 as **IchAnTool**, a script that turned hand-segmented core images into bioturbation series.
It was renamed **CorAnTool** in 2026 and **SedCoreTool** from version 0.52. Files and code written under the earlier
names keep working: older `.corantool` project packages open, and the Python package can still be imported as
`ichantool`. Version 2.1 is kept unchanged in [`legacy/`](legacy/), archived in Zenodo
([doi:10.5281/zenodo.3518837](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3518837)) and tagged `v2.1` in this repository. The former
repository addresses redirect here.
