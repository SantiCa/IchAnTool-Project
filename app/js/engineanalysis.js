// @ts-check
// With the engine experiment on, section bins come from the engine instead of the JavaScript calculation (M8.3.7).
// This module decides when a section needs a new analysis, keeps its state (pending, ready, error) and publishes a
// result only if the section's revision is still the one that was requested. It never computes bins itself and never
// falls back to the JavaScript calculation: a failure is shown as an error state. No DOM; the client is passed in.
